Iâ€™m Shuo Yin, a senior student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Soon, I will be pursuing a Master's degree in Finance at Tsinghua University. During my undergraduate studies, I gained hands-on experience with engineering projects, focusing primarily on the intersection of deep learning and its applications in finance and biomedical fields. My interest in the finance industry was sparked during my research internship, and I'm currently seeking opportunities to further explore this field through internships or full-time roles.
